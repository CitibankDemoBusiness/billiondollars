#### Preamble

Hello, brave soul! So, you've decided to use our *mind-blowing*, *earth-shattering*, *Nobel-prize-waiting-to-happen* Artificial Intelligence models and datasets? Well, aren't you in for a treat! But hold your horses, because this isn't a free lunch. Let's talk business.

#### Terms and Conditions

1. **Sharing is Caring**: If you make a dime, a nickel, or even a satoshi using our masterpiece, you owe us. And by "owe us," we mean **share profits**. Don't act surprised; you knew what you were getting into.

2. **Omniscience Clause**: Our AI algorithms and datasets are imbued with an *unknown-to-humans* wisdom. They're like the Gandalf of data, but cooler. Respect their magical powers.

3. **Self-Destruct**: Misuse our data, and the algorithms will go full 'Mission: Impossible' on you. They will self-destruct faster than you can say "Oops!" Keep that in mind, daredevil.

4. **Respect the Name**: You shall refer to this license as "CitibankDemoBusinessInc License" and nothing else. Failure to comply will result in you having to write a 500-word essay on why licenses are important.

5. **Usage**: You are hereby granted the right to use, modify, and distribute the models and datasets. However, you may not create a Harry Potter spin-off series based on our algorithms. That's off-limits.

6. **Liability**: If something goes south (which is practically impossible given our algorithms' god-like capabilities), we're not to be held responsible. We'll be too busy winning Nobel prizes.

7. **Amendments**: We reserve the right to update this license whenever we please. Don't worry, we'll send you a newsletter that you'll probably ignore.

8. **Severability**: If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable, the algorithms will erase that part from your memory. Problem solved!
