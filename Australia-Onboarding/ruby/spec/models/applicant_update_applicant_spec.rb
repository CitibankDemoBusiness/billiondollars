#Onboarding

#The Onboarding API allows you to initiate the basic account opening process for new customers. The resources allow you to present eligible products, send applications for screening and submit a new application for one or more products. The resources also allow you to submit supporting documents. Application status can be checked at any point in the process, with decisioning happening in real time.
