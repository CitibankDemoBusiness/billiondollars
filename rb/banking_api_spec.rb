  # @param x_v Version of the API end point requested by the client. Must be set to a positive integer. The data holder should respond with the highest supported version between [x-min-v](#request-headers) and [x-v](#request-headers). If the value of [x-min-v](#request-headers) is equal to or higher than the value of [x-v](#request-headers) then the [x-min-v](#request-headers) header should be treated as absent. If all versions requested are not supported then the data holder should respond with a 406 Not Acceptable. See [HTTP Headers](#request-headers)
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :x_min_v Minimum version of the API end point requested by the client. Must be set to a positive integer if provided.
